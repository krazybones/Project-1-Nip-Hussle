Project Overview/Description: 
    The Life & Death of Nipsey Hussle The Great: 
    A fanpage website dedicated to the late Nipsey Hussle. It is a site that discusses his life, from his place of birth, till his murder and life after.

Details and/or Functionality:



Technologies Used:
    .html: This was used for the basis of the website.
    .css: This was used to the basis of all the styling displayed on the website.
    .js: This along with Bootstrap helped in bringing the display to "life".

Ideas for Improvement:
    More content is needed: If it is going to be a site that is truly covering one's "Life & Death" there should be no information left out.
    Better color scheme: Color scheme could stand to "pop" out more. Comes off as bland.
    Better layout: Comes off a little basic. Could stand to learn to better use some of the external libraries.
